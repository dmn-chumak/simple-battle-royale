# Simple Battle Royale

A simple implementation of the client-server architecture for a multiplayer browser game.

Server works on top of [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and WebSockets (using simple JSON commands).

Client works on top of [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [Pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/).

```bash
npm install
```

- Build client & server sources:
